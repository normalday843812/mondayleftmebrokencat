# For My Grandma

This is a special project I made for my grandma. It's a simple webpage that plays a video when you open it.

## How It Works

When you open the webpage, you'll see a Terms of Service overlay. Click the "Accept" button to start playing the video.

The video is hosted on GitHub and played using the HTML5 `video` tag. The webpage is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Viewing the Webpage

You can view the webpage at this URL: https://kaistewart2019.github.io/formygrandma/
